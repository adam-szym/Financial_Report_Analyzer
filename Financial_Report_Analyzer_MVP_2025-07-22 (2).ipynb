    "This notebook lets you query, compare, and summarize key numbers and trends from multiple banks’ financial reports (PDF or text), using semantic search and a local LLM to produce plain-English output.\n",

    "**========== SUMMARY FROM LLM ==========**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plain English Year-in-Review Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue Growth Driven by Payments and Wealth Management:** Revenue increased significantly across all quarters, particularly driven by the Payments segment (up 9% YoY in Q1, 11% in Q3) and Wealth Management (AUM growth of 3.9T USD and asset management fees up 15% in Q3). This suggests a successful strategy to expand into higher-margin payment services and attract more assets under management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Investment Banking Boom – A Temporary Tailwind:** Investment Banking fees saw a dramatic surge in Q3, increasing by 31%. While this is impressive, it's likely fueled by high deal volume and M&A activity, indicating a potentially temporary boost rather than a fundamental shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shifting Deposits & Increased Lending:** Client Deposits grew significantly in Q3 (up 17% YoY), demonstrating increased trust and demand for the bank’s services. Simultaneously, loan volume increased modestly (2% YoY), indicating a willingness to borrow despite rising interest rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credit Costs Remain Low – Underwriting Discipline Pays Off:** Credit losses remained remarkably low throughout the year, with only 32M USD in Q1 dropping to 316M USD in Q3. This reflects strong underwriting standards and effective risk management, benefiting the bank's profitability. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wealth Management Driving Key Metrics:**  Record long-term net inflows of 72B USD in AWM and asset management fees up 15% in Q3 highlight the bank’s growing strength in wealth management. This area is now contributing a very large portion of revenue. \n",
    "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Plain English Year-in-Review Summary**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Revenue Growth Driven by Payments and Wealth Management:** Revenue increased significantly across all quarters, particularly driven by the Payments segment (up 9% YoY in Q1, 11% in Q3) and Wealth Management (AUM growth of $3.9T and asset management fees up 15% in Q3). This suggests a successful strategy to expand into higher-margin payment services and attract more assets under management.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Investment Banking Boom – A Temporary Tailwind:** Investment Banking fees saw a dramatic surge in Q3, increasing by 31%. While this is impressive, it's likely fueled by high deal volume and M&A activity, indicating a potentially temporary boost rather than a fundamental shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Shifting Deposits & Increased Lending:** Client Deposits grew significantly in Q3 (up 17% YoY), demonstrating increased trust and demand for the bank’s services. Simultaneously, loan volume increased modestly (2% YoY), indicating a willingness to borrow despite rising interest rates. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Credit Costs Remain Low – Underwriting Discipline Pays Off:** Credit losses remained remarkably low throughout the year, with only $32M in Q1 dropping to $316M in Q3. This reflects strong underwriting standards and effective risk management, benefiting the bank's profitability. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Wealth Management Driving Key Metrics:**  Record long-term net inflows of $72B in AWM and asset management fees up 15% in Q3 highlight the bank’s growing strength in wealth management. This area is now contributing a very large portion of revenue. \n",

      "\n",
      "- **Strong Overall Performance, But Shifting Priorities:** The company reported $4.8 billion in net income and $17.7 billion in revenue, driven primarily by its card services and mobile customer growth. This indicates a continued strength in their core business but also a shift in focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Card Services Dominate Growth:** The card services segment ($6.1B) is the primary engine of growth, with a 9% increase in card volume. This suggests a successful strategy focused on expanding their credit card user base and driving spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Markets Business Now Significant:** The Markets division – encompassing fixed income, equity markets, and IB fees – now contributes substantially to revenue ($8.0B). This reflects a strategic move toward higher-margin, transactional activities. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Credit Losses Increasing, But Controlled:** Credit losses rose to $1.9 billion, including $2.0B in charge-offs.  The company’s reserve releases ($72M) helped mitigate the impact, demonstrating an attempt to anticipate future risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Efficiency Efforts Underway:** With a 53-54% overhead ratio, the company is actively managing costs.  This indicates an effort to control expenses while maintaining the company's current level of profitability. \n",
